The submissions for the surprise problems will be accepted only within 30 minutes of the release of problems.</li>			<li>There will be two cases for each of the problems - a large case and a small case and there will be separate answers for each of them. The submission for the large case will be allowed only after that of small case has been accepted successfully but both the cases will be disclosed at the time of problem release.</li>			<li>Answers for both the cases will be evaluated as soon as they are submitted but only the result for small case will be intimated immediately while the result for the large case will be intimated after the contest gets over.</li>			<li>Answers for each of the problems will be positive integers. You need to submit only the answers for each of the problems.</li>			<li>A maximum of 20 submissions for any problem are allowed. But only the last submission will be used for evaluation.</li>			<li>Event organizers may ask for the explanation of any solution submitted by you, failure to which may lead to disqualification.</li>		</ol>				<h3>Important Dates</h3>		<ul>			<li>Trial Run <strong>Tue, Mar 13, 2012 at 10:00 pm</strong></li>			<li>Main Event <strong>Tue, Mar 20, 2012 at 10:00pm</strong></li>		</ul>				<p class="head fleft">Prizes</p>	<span class="top big"><a href="#">top</a></span>		<p>Projects presented at the event shall be eligible for prizes and gifts, details of which shall be updated shortly.</p>		<br />				<p class="head fleft">Contacts</p>	<span class="top big"><a href="#">top</a></span>		<p>Queries may be sent to <a href="mailto:prayaas.adhyayan@itbhu.ac.in">prayaas.adhyayan@itbhu.ac.in</a>.</p>		<div class="contact">		<h3>Event Coordinator</h3>		<p><strong>Gurpreet Singh</strong></p>		<p><a href="mailto:gurpreet.singh.cse08@itbhu.ac.in">gurpreet.singh.cse08@itbhu.ac.in</a></p>		<p><a href="tel:919648089759">+91-9648-089-759</a></p>		<h3>Challenge Panel Members</h3>		<p><a href="mailto:shivam.gupta.cse08@itbhu.ac.in">Shivam Gupta</a></p>		<p><a href="mailto:aseem.kumar.cse08@itbhu.ac.in">Aseem Kumar</a></p>		<p><a href="mailto:akash.agrawal.cse09@itbhu.ac.in">Akash Agrawal</a></p>		<p><a href="mailto:sahitya.agrawal.cse09@itbhu.ac.in">Sahitya Agrawal</a></p>		<p><a href="mailto:chirag.agrawal.cse09@itbhu.ac.in">Chirag Agrawal</a></p>		<p><a href="mailto:kapil.agrawal.cse09@itbhu.ac.in">Kapil Agrawal</a></p>		</div>		</div>
