Often referred to as Benaras, Varanasi is the oldest living city in the world.</p>	<br />	<p>"Benaras is older than history, older than tradition, older than legend and looks twice as old as all of them put together" -- Mark Twain</p>	<br />	<p>Considered as the abode of Lord Shiva, Varanasi is situated on the banks of River Ganges, which is believed to have the power of washing away all of one's sins. As pundits here will tell you, whatever is sacrificed and chanted here or given in charity reaps its fruits thousand times more than those good deeds performed at other places because of the power of that place.</p>	<br />	<p> In Varanasi, there are temples at every few paces. Looking at the number of temples in Varanasi, it is hard to believe that a large number of them were demolished during the medieval times. Jyotirlinga Visvanatha Temple or Golden Temple, rebuilt in 1776, is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The Jnana Vapi well (meaning 'Well of Wisdom) is believed to have been dug by Lord Shiva himself. It is believed that the majestic Alamgir mosque has replaced one of the most ancient shrines known as the temple of Bindu Madhava. The thirty-three hundred million shrines fill one with awe and wonder with sheer numbers.</p>	<br />	<p>The Ganga Ghats (river front) are the most popular pilgrimage spot of Varanasi and are centers of music and learning. There is a great tradition of Yatras in the holy city of Kashi and the most sacred path is that of Panchkoshi Parikrama, the fifty-mile path with a radius of five miles that cover 108 shrines along the way, with Panchakoshi Temple as its main shrine. Other popular pilgrimage route is Nagara Pradakshina, which covers seventy-two shrines along the way. Since time immemorial Varanasi is a great center of learning. The holy city has been a symbol of spiritualism, philosophy and mysticism for thousands of years and has produced great saints and personalities like Guatama Buddha, Mahavira, Kabir, Tulsi Das, Shankaracharaya, Ramanuja and Patanjali.</p>	<br />	<h3>Location on Map</h3>	<iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=varanasi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Varanasi,+Uttar+Pradesh&amp;gl=in&amp;t=m&amp;z=11&amp;ll=25.317645,82.973914&amp;output=embed"></iframe><br /><small><a href="http://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=varanasi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Varanasi,+Uttar+Pradesh&amp;gl=in&amp;t=m&amp;z=11&amp;ll=25.317645,82.973914&amp;source=embed" style="color:#0000FF;text-align:left" target="_blank">View Larger Map</a></small></div>
