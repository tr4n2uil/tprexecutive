	<div id="acd-overview" class="tile-content ui-academics ui-replace" >		<h1>Academics Overview</h1>		<p>The departments equip students with the best possible trades of an engineer through their rigorous regime of classes and laboratoray sessions for five days a week. The academic session is divided in two semesters with 100 working days in odd semester and 80 working days in even semester. Growth of the students is constantly monitored by "Class Tests" and regular "Assignments". To continue the momentum of studies each semester has two "Mid semester test" whose marks add up and decide the overall performance of a particular student.</p>		<br />		<p>As an indication of academic excellence achieved by Institute of Technology, four of its Engineering Departments are recognized by UGC as Center of Advanced Study; two others are recognized for Special Assistance Programme. In addition, six departments have also received UGC support under the COSIST programme and eight departments have received support under FIST programme of DST, New Delhi. The DST also established the National Electron Microscope Facility (NELMIF) way back in 1982. The Departments of Metallurgical and Mining Engineering have been identified as centers under the Quality Improvement Programme. It has been consistently ranked in the top 10 engineering institutions of the country in various surveys.</p>		<br />		<p><img src="ui/img/page/department.jpg" class="full"/></p>		<br />		<p>The Institute through its demanding curriculum has made it mandatory for all students to pursue an Industrial Internship Programs in their third year accompained by the Industrial Tour to the various department concerned industries. </p>		<p>All the laboratories of the institute are equipped with modern instruments and machinery to equip students with the fundamental knowledge pertaining to their respective streams. All the departments are equiped with the latest and world class technology through their "Sophisticated Instrument Laboratories".</p>		<br />		<p>Various Seminars and Guest lectures are organised by the institute to gear up the students for the outside world and to help them keep pace with the changing scenario in industries and research.Professional Communication is a necessary part of the student curriculum.</p>	</div>		<div id="acd-disciplines" class="tile-content ui-academics ui-replace" >		<h1>Academic Disciplines</h1>				<div class="block">		<h2>B.Tech (4 year)</h2>		<p>			<ul>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/cer" target="_blank">Ceramic Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/che" target="_blank">Chemical Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/civ" target="_blank">Civil Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/cse" target="_blank">Computer Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/eee" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/ece" target="_blank">Electronics Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/mec" target="_blank">Mechanical Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/met" target="_blank">Metallurgical Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/min" target="_blank">Mining Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/phe" target="_blank">Pharmaceutical Engineering</a></li>			</ul>		</p>		<h2>M.Tech (2 year)</h2>		<p>			<ul>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/bce" target="_blank">Bio-Chemical Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/bme" target="_blank">Bio-Medical Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/cer" target="_blank">Ceramic Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/che" target="_blank">Chemical Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/civ" target="_blank">Civil Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/cse" target="_blank">Computer Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/eee" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/ece" target="_blank">Electronics Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/mst" target="_blank">Material Science &amp; Technology</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/mec" target="_blank">Mechanical Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/met" target="_blank">Metallurgical Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/min" target="_blank">Mining Engineering</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/phe" target="_blank">Pharmaceutical Engineering</a></li>			</ul>		</p>		</div>				<div class="block">		<h2>Integrated Dual Degree (5 year)</h2> 		<p>			<ul>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/bce" target="_blank">Bio-Chemical Engineering</a></li> 				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/bme" target="_blank">Bio-Medical Engineering</a></li> 				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/cer" target="_blank">Ceramic Engineering </a></li> 				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/civ" target="_blank">Civil Engineering</a></li> 				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/cse" target="_blank">Computer Engineering</a></li> 				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/eee" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering</a></li> 				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/app" target="_blank">Engineering Physics</a></li> 				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/apc" target="_blank">Industrial Chemistry</a></li>				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/mst" target="_blank">Materials Science &amp; Technology</a></li> 				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/apm" target="_blank">Mathematics &amp; Computing</a></li> 				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/mec" target="_blank">Mechanical Engineering</a></li> 				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/met" target="_blank">Metallurgical Engineering</a></li> 				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/min" target="_blank">Mining Engineering</a></li> 				<li><a href="http://itbhu.ac.in/phe" target="_blank">Pharmaceutical Engineering</a></li> 			</ul> 		</p>		</div>	</div>		<div id="acd-beyond" class="tile-content ui-academics ui-replace">		<h1>Beyond Academics</h1>		<p>Students at IT-BHU enjoy a very vibrant campus life, which besides regular academics is full of extra curricular activities, thus networking them in a social atmosphere.
